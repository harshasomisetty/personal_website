my new website
* architecture
First, I implemented a [[https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-a-gatsby-blog-from-scratch/][basic gatsby blog structure]]

to explain the article, we have graph ql queries out markdown files, and making those blogposts

then we "dynamically" create pages so that we have links to individual posts, wich I need
this is done by *nodes* in gatsby, which we turn into "slugs" with graph ql (the code in gatsby-node.js)
finally, with the code in templates/blog-post.js, we spawn pages for the slugs

(again, we first generate slug paths in gatsby-node, then that slug is used in the rest of the cose)

[[https://blog.logrocket.com/using-gatsby-with-tailwind-css-a-tutorial-with-examples/][added tailwind support and layout component]]

* file structure
gatsby config file has site's metadata, plugins, and general config

each default export in src/pages is a url submodule
