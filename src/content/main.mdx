# Harsha Somisetty

### Math, CS, Stats @ Rutgers'23

I love learning, and focused undergrad grinding the fundamentals in technology and mathematical theory, with a touch of Philosophy and Poli Sci.

I spent the last couple months diving into Emacs and revamping my life and personal information management.

In my free time, I'm into Crypto/Web3, and generally interested in History, Life Extension, and Spirituality. I also practice calisthentics everyday, and play the guitar.
